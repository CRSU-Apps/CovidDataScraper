# COVID Data Scraper

Scripts used to extract data from a living network meta-analysis during 2020 for feeding into MetaInsight-COVID.

This was setup to run once per week to gather data from forest plot images, highlight the modified regions, then email those highlighted plots to a researcher to extract the data manually.

There was also a subscription script which monitored the email inbox so that researchers could subscribe for the emails without needing to interact with the host machine.
